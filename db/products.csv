39451746,RRD Evolution MK7 5.0m2,250,sail,"The Evolution was the first sail in the RRD line up and it is all about taking your windsurfing to the next level. A performance freeride sail that mixes superb handling, great acceleration and massive top end. A sail line that evolves through the sizes, from a great handling 4.4 to a powerful and stable 8.0. The Evolution's aim is to get every rider planning as quickly as possible and spend more time having maximum fun on the water. A powerful foil offers plenty of low end, whilst at the top end, the use of tube rod battens assures a stable profile even when the wind picks up.",/images/products/RRD-Evolution.png
26896768,2016 RRD Vogue HD MK7 4.2m2,592,sail,"The Vogue is all about control. Neutral and balanced, the Vogue can handle everything with ease, from onshore to side shore. <br> After over 2 years of testing the Vogue Mk7 is now with 4 battens throughout the entire range. Thanks to changes in the outline and shaping of the larger sizes we were able to offer the same control and stability of the previous 5 batten model, but with the lighter and more responsive feel of the 4 batten design. At the request of the team we also increased the power slightly, therefore increasing its range of use and improving its global usage. <br> This is the sail for those that prefer a light feel. Finger tip balance and a steady power towards the front of the sail means that no matter how strong the wind gets the sail remains perfectly in control. For those that like to forget about the sail and focus on their sailing.",/images/products/RRD-Vogue-HD.png
